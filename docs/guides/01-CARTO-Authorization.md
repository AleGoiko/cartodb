## CARTO Authorization 

All requests to Carto’s APIs (Maps, Sql, etc.) require you to authenticate with an API Key.
API Keys identify your project and provide a powerful and flexible primitive for managing access to Carto’s resources like APIs and Datasets.

These API Keys can be provisioned, revoked and regenerated through the [Auth API]({{site.authapi_docs}}/reference/) or the [Dashboard]().
